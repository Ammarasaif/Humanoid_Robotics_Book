# Content Standards and Style Guide for Module 04: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

## Writing Style

- Use university-level educational content with beginner-friendly approach
- Follow "why before how" approach - explain purpose before implementation details
- Maintain technical, objective, educational tone only (no marketing language)
- Ensure progressive complexity - concepts build upon each other sequentially

## Technical Content Requirements

- Include engineering-focused explanations with practical applications
- Provide text-described conceptual diagrams for visualization
- Include relevant code snippets for ROS 2, LLM, Whisper, and Computer Vision
- Offer practical guidance for limited hardware setups
- Include real-world humanoid robotics examples

## Markdown Structure

- Use H1 for main title (one per document)
- Use H2 for main sections
- Use H3 for subsections as needed
- Use bullet points for lists and key concepts
- Use bold formatting for important terms

## Code Snippet Standards

- Use appropriate language identifiers in code blocks (```python, ```bash, etc.)
- Include comments explaining complex code sections
- Ensure code examples are relevant to VLA concepts
- Use realistic but simplified examples for educational purposes

## Linking Standards

- Use relative links between module pages
- Include navigation links at the bottom of each page
- Use descriptive link text
- Maintain consistent link patterns throughout the module
