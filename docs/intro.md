# Book Information

Welcome to the **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book**, a comprehensive guide to building intelligent humanoid robotic systems.

## About This Book

This book is structured into four comprehensive modules that progressively build your understanding of humanoid robotics:

- **Module 01: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** - Introduction to ROS 2 as the middleware backbone of robotic systems
- **Module 02: [Module Name]** - Advanced topics in robotic control systems
- **Module 03: [Module Name]** - Physical AI and machine learning integration
- **Module 04: [Module Name]** - Advanced humanoid robotics applications

## Getting Started

Begin your journey by exploring the modules in sequence, starting with Module 01, which introduces the foundational concepts of ROS 2 and its role as the "nervous system" of robotic applications.

Each module contains multiple chapters that combine theoretical concepts with practical implementation, providing you with both the knowledge and hands-on experience needed to develop sophisticated humanoid robotic systems.

## Navigation

Use the sidebar to navigate between book sections. Each module can be expanded to show its individual chapters, allowing you to progress through the material at your own pace.
