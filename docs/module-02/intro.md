# Module 02: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

This module introduces students to the concept of digital twins in robotics, focusing on simulation frameworks for humanoid robots. Digital twins are virtual replicas of physical systems that enable testing, validation, and development of robotic systems in a safe and cost-effective environment.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, students will be able to:
- Understand the fundamental concepts of digital twins in robotics
- Configure physics simulation in Gazebo for humanoid robots
- Model humanoid robots with accurate sensor simulation
- Use Unity for high-fidelity simulation environments
- Validate simulation results against real robot behavior
- Apply domain randomization techniques for sim-to-real transfer

## Module Overview

This module covers two primary simulation frameworks used in robotics:

1. **Gazebo** - A physics-based simulation environment ideal for testing robot dynamics, sensors, and control algorithms
2. **Unity** - A high-fidelity graphics engine suitable for photorealistic rendering and human-robot interaction scenarios

We'll explore how to create accurate digital representations of humanoid robots, simulate their behavior in various environments, and validate our simulation results against real-world performance.
