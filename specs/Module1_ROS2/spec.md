# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

## Overview
This module introduces students to Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) as the middleware backbone of humanoid and robotic systems, explaining how communication, control, and robot description work together.

## Target Audience
- AI and robotics students
- Developers learning humanoid robotics
- Engineers transitioning into ROS 2 and physical AI systems

## Module Structure
The module contains exactly four chapters with clear learning focus, organized for progressive learning:

### Chapter 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals
- Purpose: Introduce ROS 2 as a robotic middleware
- Scope: Why ROS 2 exists, high-level architecture, and core concepts
- Outcome: Reader understands ROS 2's role in robot control systems

### Chapter 2: ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, and Services
- Purpose: Explain ROS 2 communication primitives
- Scope: Nodes, publishers, subscribers, topics, services
- Outcome: Reader understands how data flows in a ROS-based system

### Chapter 3: Bridging Python Agents with ROS 2 using rclpy
- Purpose: Show how Python-based AI agents interact with ROS controllers
- Scope: rclpy concepts, control flow, agent-to-robot communication
- Outcome: Reader understands how AI logic connects to physical robots

### Chapter 4: Understanding URDF for Humanoid Robots
- Purpose: Explain robot structure modeling
- Scope: URDF basics, links, joints, humanoid-specific considerations
- Outcome: Reader understands how humanoid bodies are described and simulated

## Book Layout Requirements
- The book is organized into Modules
- Each Module contains exactly four Chapters
- Each Chapter is an individual page
- Modules are visually and structurally separated
- Chapter order follows a progressive learning path
- Layout supports diagrams, code blocks, and callouts (future scope)

## Success Criteria
- Book layout is logically structured for long-form technical reading
- Navigation supports modules and chapters clearly
- Module 1 contains exactly four chapters with clear learning focus
- Structure is compatible with Docusaurus sidebar and routing
- Layout can scale to additional modules later

## Constraints
- No code snippets or implementation details at this stage
- No writing of chapter content yet
- No diagrams or assets creation
- Focus strictly on structure and layout definition
- No ROS 2 installation guides
- No simulation or hardware tutorials
- No code examples
- No styling, theming, or UI customization

## Out of Scope for this Spec
- Chapter content writing
- ROS 2 installation guides
- Simulation or hardware tutorials
- Code examples
- Styling, theming, or UI customization

## Next Steps
- After approval, proceed to /sp.plan to define execution strategy
- Then /sp.tasks to break work into steps
- Finally /sp.implement to generate the actual book structure and content
