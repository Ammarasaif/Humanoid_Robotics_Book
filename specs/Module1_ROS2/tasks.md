- [ ] T005 Configure Docusaurus sidebar for Module 01 navigation
- [ ] T006 Set up consistent file naming conventions for chapters

## Phase 3: [US1] Chapter 1 - Introduction to ROS 2
- [ ] T007 [US1] Create Chapter 1 directory: Chapter_01_Introduction_to_ROS_2
- [ ] T008 [US1] Create Chapter 1 content file with proper frontmatter
- [ ] T009 [US1] Implement Introduction to ROS 2 as the robotic nervous system content
- [ ] T010 [US1] Add proper headings, sections, and formatting to Chapter 1
- [ ] T011 [US1] Test Chapter 1 navigation and rendering

## Phase 4: [US2] Chapter 2 - ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, and Services
- [ ] T012 [US2] Create Chapter 2 directory: Chapter_02_ROS_2_Nodes_Topics_and_Services
- [ ] T013 [US2] Create Chapter 2 content file with proper frontmatter
- [ ] T014 [US2] Implement content about ROS 2 nodes, topics, and services
- [ ] T015 [US2] Add technical explanations and examples to Chapter 2
- [ ] T016 [US2] Test Chapter 2 navigation and rendering

## Phase 5: [US3] Chapter 3 - Building Python Agents with rclpy
- [ ] T017 [US3] Create Chapter 3 directory: Chapter_03_Building_Python_Agents_with_rclpy
- [ ] T018 [US3] Create Chapter 3 content file with proper frontmatter
- [ ] T019 [US3] Implement content about building Python agents with rclpy
- [ ] T020 [US3] Add Python code examples and explanations to Chapter 3
- [ ] T021 [US3] Test Chapter 3 navigation and rendering

## Phase 6: [US4] Chapter 4 - ROS 2 Services and Communication Patterns
- [ ] T022 [US4] Create Chapter 4 directory: Chapter_04_ROS_2_Services_and_Communication_Patterns
- [ ] T023 [US4] Create Chapter 4 content file with proper frontmatter
- [ ] T024 [US4] Implement content about ROS 2 services and communication patterns
- [ ] T025 [US4] Add communication pattern examples to Chapter 4
- [ ] T026 [US4] Test Chapter 4 navigation and rendering

## Phase 7: [US5] Chapter 5 - URDF Fundamentals for Humanoid Robots
- [ ] T027 [US5] Create Chapter 5 directory: Chapter_05_URDF_Fundamentals_for_Humanoid_Robots
- [ ] T028 [US5] Create Chapter 5 content file with proper frontmatter
- [ ] T029 [US5] Implement content about URDF fundamentals for humanoid robots
- [ ] T030 [US5] Add URDF examples and explanations to Chapter 5
- [ ] T031 [US5] Test Chapter 5 navigation and rendering

## Phase 8: [US6] UI and Styling Enhancement
- [ ] T032 [US6] Update custom CSS for professional technical book appearance
- [ ] T033 [US6] Implement typography improvements for technical content
- [ ] T034 [US6] Add code block styling for technical examples
- [ ] T035 [US6] Implement table styling for technical specifications
- [ ] T036 [US6] Test UI changes across all chapters

## Phase 9: [US7] Integration and Testing
- [ ] T037 [US7] Test navigation between all chapters in Module 01
- [ ] T038 [US7] Verify sidebar configuration works correctly
- [ ] T039 [US7] Validate consistent module/chapter structure
- [ ] T040 [US7] Test responsive design on different screen sizes
- [ ] T041 [US7] Verify all links and cross-references work correctly

## Phase 10: Polish and Cross-Cutting Concerns
- [ ] T042 Update module title to match actual implementation
- [ ] T043 Review and refine all chapter content for consistency
- [ ] T044 Optimize images and assets for web delivery
- [ ] T045 Final testing of all navigation and functionality
- [ ] T046 Document any deviations from original specification

## Dependencies
- Phase 2 (Foundational Structure) must complete before any chapter content phases
- Each chapter phase can run in parallel after Phase 2 completion
- Phase 8 (UI Enhancement) can begin after initial content creation
- Phase 9 (Integration Testing) requires all previous phases to be complete

## Parallel Execution Examples
- Chapters 1-5 can be developed in parallel after foundational structure is in place
- UI enhancements can be done in parallel with content creation
- Testing can begin as soon as initial content is available

## Independent Test Criteria
- [US1] Chapter 1 should render correctly with proper navigation
- [US2] Chapter 2 should render correctly with proper navigation
- [US3] Chapter 3 should render correctly with proper navigation
- [US4] Chapter 4 should render correctly with proper navigation
- [US5] Chapter 5 should render correctly with proper navigation
- [US6] UI changes should be consistent across all chapters
- [US7] Navigation should work seamlessly between all components

## MVP Scope
Minimum Viable Product includes Phase 1-2 (setup and foundational structure) plus one chapter (Chapter 1) with basic navigation.
